# SemEval-POLAR-Task9-Subtask1_NUSTBYTES
Introduction: Online polarization, marked by emotionally charged or biased language between opposing groups, is a growing problem in digital spaces signaling rising social fragmentation, making early detection crucial for maintaining constructive dialogue. The POLAR @ SemEval-2026 Task 9 tackles this by detecting polarized content across 22 languages from platforms like news sites, Reddit, blogs, and forums. Subtask 1 focuses on classifying posts as polarized or not. We're dealing with English, Spanish and German data.
